# GutenReader

Living in a small, paper-thin walled apartment in Denver, Fenton was reading a book late one night. As the story was intensifying, so was Fenton's heart rate, and also the plot in neighbor's TV show in the apartment next door. Fenton turned the page to read something astonishing as the show reached its peak plot and music volume!!

GutenReader provides the user with a cinematic experience. It is an eReader built on the Project Gutenberg API that performs sentiment analysis (with IBM Watson) to determine the mood of the current page and plays music (with Spotify) that matches that mood. Designed with accessibility in mind!
