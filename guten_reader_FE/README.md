# Guten Reader

Living in a small, paper-thin walled apartment in Denver, Fenton was reading a book late one night. As the book's plot line is intensifying, so is Fenton's heart rate! Then in the apartment door, the family begins watching an intense movie.

Guten Reader is an eReader that performs sentiment analysis of the text on the page and plays a song as you read that matches the mood of text!
